The Gendered Machine is an interactive web project that explores how algorithmic systems classify, construct, and reinforce gender through data. 
Inspired by scholarship from Anne Fausto-Sterling, John Cheney-Lippold, and critical algorithm studies, this project translates complex theory into an accessible, 
explorable experience for non-academic audiences.  Rather than presenting gender classification as a technical problem alone, this project argues that digital platforms 
actively produce gendered categories through inference pipelines, probabilistic scoring, and feedback loops. Through sliders, simulations, and case studies, users can see 
how everyday interactions, clicks, searches, and engagement — may be transformed into demographic assumptions that shape the content they receive

This project is an educational simulation, not a real algorithm or predictive system.
The models, scores, personas, and categories shown are intentionally simplified to help explain complex sociotechnical ideas. Real-world algorithms use far more signals, proprietary models, and business constraints than represented here.

The site does not collect or analyze real user data.

Outputs do not represent a user’s real identity or gender.
